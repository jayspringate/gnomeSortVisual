# gnomeSortVisual

This repository contains a website that visually demonstrates an application of the gnome sort algorithm to an alphabetically-ordered list of the top college basketball programs by all-time win percentage. There is a home page that contains a description of gnome sort, and the home page links to a page that visually performs a sort when prompted by a button click.

The basketball wallpaper that is the site's background image was sourced from hdwallsource.com.

The college logos were sourced from sportslogos.com.

The gnome image is from a sculpture manufactured by Heritage Farms.

The html contains no div's. Nada. Zero. I defy you to find a div. There are also no sections, which are nearly as worthless. I have strong opinions about this.
