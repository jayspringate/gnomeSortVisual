				<h1 class="headers top">What is gnome sort?</h1>
				<p class="info">Gnome sort is a sorting algorithm. It operates by finding the first position where two elements are out of order and swapping them. This process repeats until the items are fully sorted.
				</p>
				<h1 class="headers">How did it get the name "gnome sort"?</h1>
				<p class="info">A computer scientist observed that the algorithm mimics how a gnome would sort flower pots. Because the gnome cannot see over any of the pots, he can only deal with the two on either side of him in his current position.
				</p>
				<h1 class="headers below-image">Does gnome sort have any advantages?</h1>
				<p class="info below-image">Glad you asked! Actually, it does. Because the gnome can only deal with his current position, he does not have to remember any other positions. The space complexity of gnome sort is merely O(1).
				</p>
				<h1 class="headers below-image">True. But it probably takes forever.</h1>
				<p class="info below-image">Yes it does. Gnome sort has a time complexity of O(n^2). For this reason, it also goes by the name "stupid sort".
				</p>
				<h1 class="headers below-image">Are gnomes real?</h1>
				<p class="info below-image">Modern science is undecided.
				</p>
				<h1 class="headers below-image">Can I see a gnome sort in action?</h1>
				<p class="info below-image">Yes you can! <a href="gnomeSortVisual.html">Click the link</a> to see a gnome sort of college basketball programs by all-time win percentage.
